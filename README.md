# D&D Writing club!!
This is a place to put all the small stories and adventure ideas for dnd.
I put some ideas below as a example. I kinda want to keep this going.

## Sections 
Sections are just here to seperate out ideas into catagories. 
Each section

- Dungeons 
  - All classic D&D dungeon designs  
  - Encounters, Monsters, Maps, Story. 
- Stories
  - Individual Story Arc ideas.
- Campaigns
  - Multi-Part campaigns.
- Oneshots
  - Small story arcs ment to be self suffecient.



## Adding to the collection.
Just make a directory in one of the sections directories.

```
Example: Adding Gobos as a story
Dungeons\
| Wizard Tower
  | Maps
  | Layout.md
  | Start.md
  | Room1.md
  | Room2.md
Stories
| Amnisia War
  | idk.md
| << Gobos
  
```

## Branches?
I dont know? Probably dont need to worry about it. 
This is mostly just for keeping a central record of the stories.
